Whta is actually the bootstrap?
Bootstarp is an open source frontend or UI framework also sometimes called the css framework and it is created for very fast web development or UI development. and it gives us tons of tools to create websites and applications UI, here we get all type of utility classes for margin, padding, typography and so on as well as components classes like pre-made templates for things like alerts, progress bars, we also get built in javascript widgets and plugins, and easy to use and mobile first responsive grid system,

the main advantage is that bootstrap is compatible with all browsers, it also promotes much faster developments, with pre-made classes and styling as well as responsive grid,
we dont need all types of media querries we only have to use grid and we just have a responsive website,

Javascript widgets

1- Carousal Slider(here we can have indicators, we can have arrows, we can set options like we want to go faster or slower, we can set it by using Jquerry)
2- Collapsible Accordion( if we want just a basic button to make another piece of content collapse or slide down, we can do that, we also have full fledge accordianwidgets as well)
3- Modals (Modals are basically like pop ups that can fade in nicely and we can put whatever we want in them)
4- tooltips (when we hover over on something a nice tooltip shows up)
5- popovers (are are very similar to tooltips)
6- ScrollSpy (it allows us to scroll to our content and have that piece of content highlight that are in NAV Menu , we can also implement a littlebit custom jquerry for smooth scrolling)
